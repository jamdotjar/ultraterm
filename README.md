# ULTRATERM
![Hero image](gallery/key_preview.png)

ULTRATERM is a miniature replica of an ULTRAKILL settings terminal ( like the one used in cybergrind ), that acts as a bluetooth audio player.

> ***NOTE**: this project is a WIP, check out the [journal](JOURNAL.md) for progress updates! Right now I'm:* `polishing my readme`

## Design

The terminal sits at around 125mm tall, with a 57x104mm footprint. It was designed to look cool, be fairly accurate, and act as a (mostly) stand alone device. It features a:
- 2.8" TFT display
- Touchscreen + 3 physical buttons
- A 2000mAh battery
- Bluetooth headphone support
- USB-C storage interface
- Removable SD card storage ( and a custom microSD card adapter )
The case is designed to be entirely 3D printable, and assembled without adhesive or fasteners.
While the terminal isn't a perfect replica, it's decently close. ( for example, there's none of the wires near the top, but there is a magnetic attachment point so I *can* add them )

This project was made as mostly a fun intro to custom hardware. I've made keyboards before, but design wise those are fairly simplec ( this isn't much more complicated ). I decided to shape it after the ULTRAKILL Cybergrind terminal because that's the one that handles  cybergrind music ingame, so I thought that would be a cool part to try and recreate. Even though it isn't *the* classic terminal, its form factor is also a *lot* more forgiving to fit a screen and PCB and stuff into when compared to the shop terminals, which also don't have as many good options for physical interface. 

If you happen to make your own, I'd suggest either 3d-printing it in blue for minimum effort, or printing it in grey, painting it, then scuffing the paint to give it the worn look it has in-game.
